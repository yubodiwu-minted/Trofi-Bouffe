# Trof√≠ Bouffe

This is a recipe building app with the goal of having users being able to create and maintain their own recipes, auto-generate nutrition facts form my database of ingredients, and possibly collaborate with AppriceMe to generate shopping lists for recipes.

It uses the Express library for Node.js to build servers and Knex.js for managing database connections, and ReactJS and Redux to make a dynamic, single-page application. [Try it out.](https://trofi-bouffe.herokuapp.com)
